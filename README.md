# Features
# Easy Setup: 
Spring Boot provides a streamlined development experience by minimizing configuration and boilerplate code, allowing you to quickly set up and run your Java applications.

# Convention over Configuration:
Spring Boot follows the principle of "Convention over Configuration," which means it provides sensible defaults and opinions, reducing the need for explicit configuration.

# Dependency Management: 
With Spring Boot's built-in dependency management, you can easily manage and resolve dependencies using Maven or Gradle, making it simple to add or update libraries.

# Embedded Server: 
Spring Boot includes an embedded servlet container (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) that allows you to run your application as a standalone JAR file without requiring any additional setup.

# Auto-configuration: 
Spring Boot automatically configures various components based on your classpath and configuration properties, reducing manual setup and enabling a faster development cycle.

# Spring Ecosystem:
Being part of the Spring ecosystem, Spring Boot leverages other powerful Spring projects like Spring Data, Spring Security, and Spring MVC, providing a comprehensive and robust framework for building enterprise-grade applications.
